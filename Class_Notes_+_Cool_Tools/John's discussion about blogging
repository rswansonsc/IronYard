How to win the Internet:
-becoming conversant in Internet
-becoming more competitive
-more signal, less noise
-the company you will work for will search for you on google "rtfg" - 
	 *** read the friggin google *** learn how to search google “its critical”!!!
-be different on purpose!!, have some control, have some personal branding
-buy your domain, see: iwantmyname.com
-normal responses to the way you act, carry on a conversation
-control is not a question of if, you have an opportunity, Do IT!

Setup Base Station:
-setup a point where all roads will go
-push images to google and point links to your blog
-search on google images blog templates, John uses the default template in WordPress
-John’s point of view is people are coming to your blog for content not flashy graphics

Secondary Station:
-twitter, date started
-be intentional, this is about message expansion
-go further, faster

Execution is Everything:
-be specific, make it personal, You have to Give a Shit
-do be wishy washy, have an opinion

Blogging to get exposure of what you are doing:
-be passionate about what you are doing today

Blogging Techniques:
-follow a narrative or plan
-content, your experience, snippets, perspective, pictures

-check out john.do site, this is where John writes

Build List of topic:
content, time, readership
make topics to be "Memorable" - 
	john.do/storytelling "people will always remember how you made them feel"
execution, do over think it, 
have goals, take time to think through your plans
your brand, your future, you never know,
small personal cost (15 min / week) - big opportunity cost

Additional Notes:
find a Mentor
have courageous conversations with someone you might want to have be a mentor to you
a mentor can help you figure out your chanllenges, a mentor shouldn't charge
choose a mentor wizely and commit to a path
building the most fertile enviroment for creativity is important for you
John's creative spot/time: 430am, same song looping, total focus
balance between personal life and programming code (grind time)
find your personal productivity place but keep that balance 

Have a personal Mission Statement, follow rules for SMART goals - rtfg
John's mission = spending his next 30 years being significant

Good Ideas come and go but great people who build the programs are the real jewels
a bad idea can be great if built by the right team
