cat xxxx (show contents of a file)

ls 		(list directory contents)
ls -al (lists director contents plus hidden)

mkdir (make a directory below your current location)
rm -rf sd_images (removes the directory and all the files)

cd .. (back up one level on the directory)

to reload your alias list in terminal type:
source ~/.bash_profile

** we built a .bashrc file in class so you would type:
source ~/.bashrc 

then the alias listed below will run, 
tiy "the iron yard" will kick off the alias
sub "the Sublime Text 2" editor will kick off using alias

alias sub='open -a "Sublime Text 2"'
alias tiy='open -a "Sublime Text 2" ~/ironyard'
alias nick='open -a ""Sublime Text 2" ~/nbuccdiarelli_git"

Note: If you ~/.bashrc does not run you will need to change 
a file called ~/.bash_profile

Here is a note from Stackoverflow.com:
Terminal opens a login shell. This means, ~/.bash_profile will get executed, ~/.bashrc not. The solution on most systems 
is to „require“ the ~/.bashrc in the ~/.bash_profile: 

- just put this snippet in your ~/.bash_profile file
[[ -s ~/.bashrc ]] && source ~/.bashrc
