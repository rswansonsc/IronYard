What can Rails Migration do?

create_table(name, options)

drop_table(name)

rename_table(old_name, new_name)

add_column(table_name, column_name, type, options)

rename_column(table_name, column_name, new_column_name)

change_column(table_name, column_name, type, options)

remove_column(table_name, column_name)

add_index(table_name, column_name, index_type)

remove_index(table_name, column_name)

Migrations support all the basic data types: string, text, integer, float, datetime, timestamp, time, date, binary and boolean:

string - is for small data types such as a title.

text - is for longer pieces of textual data, such as the description.

integer - is for whole numbers.

float - is for decimals.

datetime and timestamp - store the date and time into a column.

date and time - store either the date only or time only.

binary - is for storing data such as images, audio, or movies.

boolean - is for storing true or false values.

Valid column options are:

limit ( :limit => “50” )

default (:default => “blah” )

null (:null => false implies NOT NULL)
