This is a place where I put a bunch of my notes:

It helps me to write down or type notes at the instructor is going through materials, sometimes I use these notes a lot
sometimes I just keep them handy for reference later.  In an effort to learn GitHub better I have tried to put my notes in
a reasonable order and leave these out for anyone it may help.

Grab a copy to your system using a couple of simple GitHub commands, I will walk you through it - not too hard, enjoy.

1. make a directory on your system to place the git files into
2. issues a 'git init' command to get started
3. go to the main folder and then click on the link to copy or clone 
4. issue a 'git clone __paste the copied link here__ 
5. all my notes are your to have a look at 

Enjoy - hope my notes help and don't confuse you... ;-)
