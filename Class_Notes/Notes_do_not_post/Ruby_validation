at top of articles_controller.rb

*** get from Nick notes:
- in model 
class ArticlesController < ApplicationController
validates :name, presence; true
validates :address, presence; true


def create
@rolodex = Rolodex.new 
local variable

if success = true
flash [:notice] = "you were able to successfully able to -----"
redirect_to root_path

flash [:error] = "you did not enter the info"
redirect_to root_path

to see errors use in Rails Console
@rolodex.errors

*** get from Nick notes: rolodex/views/layout/_error_messages.html.erb

setup a do loop to display messages:
@rolodex.errors.messages.each do |k, v|
<%= k %>
<%= v %>
