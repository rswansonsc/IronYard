to clone another user:
* This if for Nick our instructor *
git clone https://github.com/nbucciarelli/TheIronYard.git ~/nbuccdiarelli_git

to clone another user, 
- go to https://github.com
- open the repository and look for the link on bottom right and copy that info to paste behing the "git clone" command
- enter the command:
git clone "gitusr" ~/name_where_repository_sits

if there is a change that is on the web it could cause you a problem where you are behind what is current on the web
.in example
	- changed a file on the web, like a readme.md
	- your web is now out of sync

to get this resolved 
you should add 

vi editor: will open when you do a pull 
	- the vi editor expects you to make a comment
	- you will make a comment then issue
	- enter the follow keys
	"esc" then 
	":"" and then 
	"q" to exit out of vi editor


to change the editor:
sub ~/.gitconfig (to edit gitconfig with Sublime)

add this to the user section in your ~/.gitconfig

[user]
	editor = "Sublime Text 2"
