A simple way to see what is being passed in the params variable in the request is to put something like:

#app.rb
before do
  puts '[Params]'
  p params
end
Then you can see in the terminal what is being passed.

also try this to see params if using hash:
post '/post' do
  body = params[:message]
  erb :post
end
