Sinatra:
1. Simple web tool to perform local development
2. Must load server.rb, Gemfile, in same dir
3. The Gemfile is case sensitive
4. All erb files go into the /Views folder

	Note: Github has a file ".gitignore", this file should be placed in the Master Root folder of your GitRepository locally to block some directories from being pushed to github, specifically block












A simple way to see what is being passed in the params variable in the request is to put something like:

#app.rb
before do
  puts '[Params]'
  p params
end
Then you can see in the terminal what is being passed.

also try this to see params if using hash:
post '/post' do
  body = params[:message]
  erb :post
end
